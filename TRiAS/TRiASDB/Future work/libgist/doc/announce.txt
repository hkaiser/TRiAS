Subject: Announcing the BETA release of libgist v.2.0 and amdb v.1.0.

BETA versions of libgist v.2.0 and amdb v.1.0 are now available for
trial. This combined distribution can be obtained from 
http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu.

Amdb is an access method (AM) design and visualization tool for AMs
implemented with the libgist library. Libgist is a C++ implementation
of the Generalized Search Tree (GiST). Both packages, developed at
U.C. Berkeley, have been tested and compiled on Solaris 2.6 and
Solaris 2.5.1 (both Sparc and x86). Furthermore, JDK 1.1.5 and Swing
(JFC) 1.0.2 or higher are required for using amdb. A Window 95/NT
version will be available with the upcoming final release of libgist
v.2.0 and amdb v.1.0 scheduled for March 1999.

The libgist library implements the GiST framework which enables
implementations of balanced-tree AMs.  A new AM is created by
extending the core libgist classes with a class that encapsulates the
high-level, data-oriented aspects of that AM.  It uses operating
system files for storage purposes and supports single-user access
without transactional behavior. This libgist distribution comes
prepackaged with a B-tree and several R-tree variants.

Amdb is a debugging, profiling, and visualization tool for AMs
implemented with the libgist library. Its salient features include:

1) Interactive execution of search tree operations (insert, delete and
search) and debugger-like functionality, such as breakpoints.

2) Visualization aids at various scales for browsing the search tree
during debugging and analysis. These include:

   *) Global View: an aggregate view of the search tree.

   *) Tree View: a structural view for browsing paths and subtrees.

   *) Node View: a user extensible visualization of tree nodes'
	contents.

3) Profiling tools which assess the performance of an AM. They
characterize:

   *) queries and tree structure in terms of search tree performance
      factors: clustering, utilization, and excess coverage of
      bounding predicates.

   *) structure-shaping methods of the AM extension (those that guide
      splits and insertions)

A more detailed description of the GiST framework and the amdb
analysis framework is contained in papers available from:
http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu.
