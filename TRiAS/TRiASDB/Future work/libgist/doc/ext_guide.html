This document explains how to extend libgist with new types of access
methods (AMs). The extensions are written in C++ and complement the
standard libgist class hierarchy. Before attempting to write
extensions, you should know how to use libgist as an application
programmer (refer to the libgist <A HREF="user_manual.html">User
Manual</A> for the details).

<A NAME="Overview of the Class Hierarchy"></A>Overview of the Class Hierarchy</H2>
Libgist extensions are implemented through function tables, which are provided
- true to the C++ style - in the form of classes and objects. Extension
classes implement the general behavior of AMs, whereas an object of an
extension class provides datatype-specific details. To give an example,
consider the B-tree extension supplied as part of the standard libgist
distribution. The extension class <TT>bt_ext_t</TT> implements the standard
B-tree AM (with sorted nodes and partitioning of the key space by the BPs)
without reference to any specific datatype. The extension object <TT>bt_int_ext</TT>
adds integer-specific functions (mainly comparison and storage size computation)
that complement the general behavior implemented by the class to create
an integer B-tree extension. The extension object is implemented as a function
table that can be used to create, update and query B-trees containing integer
keys.

<P>The original GiST publication [<A HREF="http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu/gist1.html#Papers">HNP95</A>]
specifies an extension interface that is relatively simple and assumes
a node organization and node traversal algorithms similar to those of R-tree
nodes (which store entries in an unordered, heap-like fashion on a page;
as a result, every entry on a page must be checked when traversing the
page or when looking for matches to a query). Libgist implements this simple
interface and another, more low-level extension interface. The latter allows
a derived extension class to implement a node layout that is tuned for
the particular AM at hand. An example of this is again the B-tree extension,
which implements ordered node entries in order to do binary search when
checking for matching entries.

<P>The following is an overview of the classes and their roles within libgist.
The classes relevant for extension designers are <TT>gist_ext_t</TT> and
<TT>gist_unordered_t</TT>.

In what follows, we will make reference to <i>cursors</i> and
<i>predicate cursors</i>.  The cursor abstraction is a standard
concept in database systems, encapsulating the notions of a kind of
file traversal (<i>e.g.</i>, depth-first search of a tree) as well as
the specific state (<i>e.g.</i>, the current location within the file)
corresponding to an instance of such a traversal.  Libgist predicate
cursors (<tt>gist_predcursor_t</tt>) are a specific realization of a
cursor for a specific index node.  Predicate cursors look like a C
array containing the set of node entries that match the current search
predicate.  More detail on cursors and on writing specialized cursors
can be found in the <a href="#behavior">next section</a>.

<H2>
<A NAME="Simple Extension Interface"></A>Simple Extension Interface</H2>
The simple extension interface implements the extension architecture described
in the original GiST publication [<A HREF="http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu/gist1.html#Papers">HNP95</A>].
This interface requires the extension implementor to supply four functions
that support navigation for queries and updates and determine the overall
physical structure of the index tree. The basis of the physical tree structure
are nodes that store their items in an arbitrary order. Consequently, one
of the core classes of the simple extension interface implements an unordered
node structure (class <TT><A HREF="#Appendix A.4: gist_unorderedn_t">gist_unorderedn_t</A></TT>).
The interface functions themselves are encapsulated in the class <TT><A HREF="#Appendix A.5: gist_unordered_t">gist_unordered_t</A></TT>
(note the missing "n"!), which serves as the base class for extension classes
that use the simple interface. The R-tree extension is an example of how
the two core classes and the user-supplied extension class fit together.
The following code snippet summarizes the class structure and the construction
of one extension object.
<PRE>class gist_ext_t {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
};
class gist_unorderedn_t : gist_ext_t {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gist_unorderedn_t::gist_unorderedn_t(const gist_unordered_t&amp; fcts);
};
class gist_unordered_t {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
};
class rt_ext_t : public gist_unordered_t {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
};
gist_unorderedn_t bt_int_ext(rt_ext_t(...));</PRE>

The R-tree example shows that:
<UL>
<LI>
extension objects are created from class <TT>gist_unorderedn_t</TT>;</LI>

<LI>
the AM-specific extension class is a subclass of <TT>gist_unordered_t</TT>;</LI>

<LI>
an (unnamed) object of the extension class is required as a parameter to
the <TT>gist_unorderedn_t</TT> constructor when creating a particular extension
object.</LI>
</UL>
The class <TT>gist_unordered_t</TT> is a virtual class, which forces an
extension subclass to provide implementations of the following procedures:
<DL>
<DT>
consistent(const void* query, const void* pred, int predlen, int level)</DT>

<DD>
This function evaluates a predicate stored on an index page with respect
to a query. The level within the tree of the page that contains the predicate
is indicated by the <TT>level</TT> parameter. The <TT>pred</TT> parameter
points to the part of an on-disk page entry that holds the predicate and
the <TT>predlen</TT> parameter contains the storage size in bytes. The
function must return <TT>true</TT> if the predicate is consistent with
the query, otherwise <TT>false</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
penalty(const void* bp, int bplen, int level, const void* key, int keylen,
gist_penalty_t&amp; p)</DT>

<DD>
This function is used to locate a leaf node when inserting a new entry.
Applied to the BP of an entry in an internal node and the predicate of
the new entry, it computes the penalty for inserting the new entry into
the subtree corresponding to the internal node's entry. The <TT>bp</TT>
parameter points to the on-disk BP and the <TT>bplen</TT> parameter specifies
its size in bytes. The <TT>key</TT> and <TT>keylen</TT> parameters point
to the key of the new entry and its length in bytes, respectively.</DD>

<DT>
union_bp(const gist_predcursor_t&amp; pcursor, 
const gist_p&amp; page,
const vec_t&amp; pred1,
const vec_t&amp; pred2,
vec_t&amp; bp,
bool&amp; bpChanged,
bool bpIsValid)</dt>

<DD>
This function computes the BP for a page and up to two additional predicates. It
is called in the following scenarios:
<ul>
<li> after inserting one or two new entries into a node, this function computes
the new BP.
</ul>

<DT>
union_key(void* bp, int&amp; bplen, int level, const void* key, int keylen,
bool&amp; changed)</DT>

<DD>
After inserting a new entry on a node, this function computes the node's
new BP as the union of the old BP and the new key. The <TT>bp</TT> and
<TT>key</TT> parameters point to the BP and the new entry's predicate,
respectively, and the <TT>bplen</TT> and <TT>keylen</TT> parameters indicate
their sizes in bytes. The <TT>level</TT> parameter indicates the level
of the page for which the BP is updated.</DD>

<DT>
union_page(void* bp, int&amp; bplen, int level, gist_predcursor_t&amp;
pcursor, bool&amp; changed)</DT>

<DD>
After deleting an entry from a page, this function computes the node's
new BP (possibly as the union of the remaining predicates on the page,
although this is not required; in fact, partitioning trees will not change
the BP). The set of predicates stored on the page is accessible through
the <TT><A HREF="#Appendix A.5: gist_unordered_t">gist_predcursor_t</A></TT>
parameter <TT>pcursor</TT>, which contains an array <TT>elems</TT> of predicate
pointer/predicate length pairs (the predicate pointers point directly to
the data stored on the index nodes, and therefore must not be modified).
The reference parameter <TT>changed</TT> must be set to <TT>true</TT> if
the BP did change.</DD>

<DT>
pickSplit(gist_predcursor_t&amp; pcursor, int level, int rightEntries[],
int&amp; numRight, const void* oldBp, int oldlen, void* leftBp, int&amp;
leftlen, void* rightBp, int&amp; rightlen)</DT>

<DD>
This function determines how a split is performed on a page overflow by
deciding which entries stay on the original node and which go on the new
right sibling. This decision is based on the set of predicates stored on
the page, which is passed in through the <TT>pcursor</TT> parameter (at
this point, no direct information about the full size of the node entries
is available; this will not be a limitation for the extension implementor,
unless the data pointers on leaf pages are varying-length). The <TT>pcursor</TT>
parameter also contains a reference to the predicate of the new entry that
caused the overflow. The split information is returned through the <TT>rightEntries</TT>
parameter, which contains the page positions (i.e., the slot indices) of
those entries on the original page that go on the new right sibling (the
<TT>numRight</TT> parameter contains the number of those entries). The
page position of each entry is equal to the array index of the corresponding
predicate in the <TT>pcursor</TT> parameter. In addition to providing the
split info, the <TT>pickSplit</TT> function must also compute the new BPs
of the original page and the new right sibling (returned through parameters
<TT>leftBp</TT> and <TT>rightBp</TT>, which point to preallocated memory,
and <TT>leftLen</TT> and <TT>rightLen</TT>, which must be set to their
lengths in bytes). A pointer to the original BP stored in the node is provided
by the <TT>oldBp</TT> parameter; this BP must not be modified.</DD>

<DT>
check(const void* bp, int bplen, const void* pred, int predlen, int level)</DT>

<DD>
This debugging function is called by <TT>gist::check() </TT>to test whether
a node's BP "contains" all of its entries. It returns <TT>true</TT> if
the BP contains the given entry, otherwise <TT>false</TT>. The parameters
have the same meaning as those for <TT>union_key</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
printPred(const void* pred, int predlen, int level)</DT>

<DD>
This debugging function prints a predicate to <TT>stdout</TT>. The <TT>pred</TT>
parameter points to on-disk data and must not be modified.</DD>

<DT>
printData(const void* data, int datalen)</DT>

<DD>
This debugging function prints a data pointer to <TT>stdout</TT>. The data
parameter points to on-disk data and must not be modified.</DD>
</DL>

<A NAME="Node-Layout Extension Interface"></A>Node-Layout Extension Interface</H2>
The node layout extension interface is the foundation of the libgist extension
architecture; it differs from the simple extension interface in that it
is an abstraction of the basic page-oriented actions like insertion and
deletion of tuples, rather than the logical properties of the data. This
gives the implementor control over how the predicates are stored on a node,
so that storage format of predicates as well as node-oriented activities
such as searching for matching predicates or searching for the minimum-penalty
predicate can be tuned for the particular tree structure.

<P>The extension implementor can design an extension class that utilizes
the node layout extension interface in two ways:
<OL>
<LI>
The extension is separated into three classes: a node layout class; a virtual
base class that specifies the data-related aspects for that particular
node layout; an implementation class for the extension itself, subclassed
from the virtual base class. The design of the R-tree extension is an example
that fits this mold: it is composed of a node layout (<TT>gist_unorderedn_t</TT>),
a virtual base class (<TT>gist_unordered_t</TT>) and an R-tree implementation
class (<TT>rt_ext_t</TT>). Factoring out the node layout in this fashion
makes sense if the particular node layout could potentially be useful for
other extensions as well.</LI>

<LI>
The extension class is a direct subclass of <TT>gist_ext_t</TT>, in which
case the storage- and data-related aspects of the extension are handled
by a single class. The B-tree extension is an example of a case which is
designed this way.</LI>
</OL>
A node layout requires the extension implementor to supply a subclass of
<TT>gist_ext_t</TT> with the virtual functions of that class implemented.
This subclass can utilize any of the <TT>gist_</TT>p (libgist page class,
which is described in more detail in the next section) member functions
for that purpose;. the implementation of the node layout is only restricted
by a few assumptions that libgist makes about the contents and structure
of a page and its entries (see the next section for the details). Other
than that, the node layout class is free to arrange page entries in any
order it desires and also compress the predicates in any way. This makes
it possible to employ B-tree style predicate compression on internal nodes
(where key intervals are only stored with one boundary, and the other boundary
is stored in one of the neighboring entries) or represent tree structures
on a page (where the nodes would be contained in page entries and the pointers
to children could be the slot indices of those entries that contain the
children). Although node layout classes are free to assign entries to slots
arbitrarily, there are restrictions on when that assignment can be changed.
In particular, slot indices must be stable from the time they are "reported
to the outside world" until the next successful call to a page modification
function. In other words, interface functions that only retrieve information
from a page cannot modify the slot assignment (although they may modify
entries).

<P>The following are the interface functions that subclasses of <TT>gist_ext_t</TT>
must implement. The parameters of class <TT>vec_t</TT> are vectors of data
pointer/length (described in more detail in the next section as well).
<DL>
<DT>
insert(gist_p&amp; page, const vec_t&amp; key, const vec_t&amp; data, shpid_t
child)</DT>

<DD>
Creates a new entry on a page and returns <TT>RCOK</TT> if it is successful
and <TT>eRECWONTFIT</TT> if there is not enough space. If the entry is
for a leaf page, the <TT>child</TT> parameter will be set to 0; if the
entry is for an internal page, the <TT>data</TT> parameter will be empty
(data.size() == 0).</DD>

<DT>
remove(gist_p&amp; page, int slots[], int numSlots)</DT>

<DD>
Removes a number of entries, which are identified by their slot indices.</DD>

<DT>
updateKey(gist_p&amp; page, int&amp; slot, const vec_t&amp; key)</DT>

<DD>
This function is only applied to internal nodes; it updates the predicate
of the entry in slot <TT>slot</TT> with the new predicate given in <TT>key</TT>.
If there is not enough space on the page, the function returns <TT>eRECWONTFIT</TT>
without having changed the slot assignment of the original entry. If the
function updates the entry successfully, it returns with <TT>RCOK</TT>
and may change the slot assignment.</DD>

<DT>
findMinPen(const gist_p&amp; page, const vec_t&amp; key, const vec_t&amp;
data, int&amp; slot)</DT>

<DD>
Finds the entry with the lowest penalty for inserting a new entry (given
by parameters <TT>key</TT> and <TT>data</TT>) into the corresponding subtree.
The index of that entry is returned through parameter <TT>slot</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
search(gist_p&amp; page, const void* query, int matches[], int&amp; numMatches)</DT>

<DD>
Searches the page for entries whose predicates are consistent with the
parameter query and returns the slot indices of those entries in the parameter
<TT>matches</TT> (matches has <TT>gist_p::max_scnt </TT>elements) and the
number of matches found in <TT>numMatches</TT>.</DD>

<DT>
getKey(gist_p&amp; page, int slot, vec_t&amp; key)</DT>

<DD>
After locating matching entries on a leaf page, this function is called
to convert the storage format of the predicates on the page to what the
calling application expects. The parameter slot specifies a single entry
from which to extract the predicate. The output parameter key receives
that predicate (<TT>key.ptr(0)</TT> points to preallocated memory of size
<TT>gist_p::max_tup_sz</TT>). If no decompression takes place, <TT>getKey</TT>
can avoid the copy operation by setting <TT>key.ptr(0)</TT> to point to
the on-page predicate. If decompression takes place (for example, when
applying prefix compression to string keys in a B-tree), <TT>getKey</TT>
must store the computed key in the memory pointed to by <TT>key.ptr(0)</TT>
and set <TT>key.len(0)</TT> to the correct length (see the B-tree code
in libbtree/gist_btree.cc for an example of how to reset <TT>vec_t </TT>objects).</DD>

<DT>
pickSplit(gist_p&amp; page, int rightEntries[], int&amp; numRight, const
vec_t&amp; oldBp, vec_t&amp; leftBp, vec_t&amp; rightBp, const vec_t&amp;
entry1, bool&amp; oneGoesRight, const vec_t&amp; entry2, bool&amp; twoGoesRight)</DT>

<DD>
This function determines how a split is performed by deciding which entries
stay on the original node and which go on the new right sibling. The split
info is returned through the <TT>rightEntries</TT> parameter, which contains
the page positions (i.e., the slot indices) of those entries on the original
page that go on the new right sibling (the <TT>numRight</TT> parameter
contains the number of those entries). <TT>PickSplit</TT> also computes
the new BPs of the original page and the new right sibling, which are returned
through the parameters <TT>leftBp</TT> and <TT>rightBp</TT>, respectively.
The new entry or entries that will be inserted on the page after the split
may influence the split and the shape of the BPs. There may be two new
entries, because an internal node will experience two insertions: one for
the parent entry of the new child node and one for the parent entry of
a split page (it was removed before the split when the update failed due
to lack of space). They are passed in as parameters <TT>entry1</TT> and
<TT>entry2</TT>. If the page to be split is a leaf page, those <TT>vec_t
</TT>parameters have two components: component 0 (<TT>&lt;x>.ptr(0)</TT>)
is the predicate and component 1 the data pointer; if the page is an internal
node, the entries only contain a predicate as component 0. If only one
entry is passed in, <TT>entry2.size()</TT> will be equal to 0. Aside from
taking the new entries into account when computing the new BPs, <TT>pickSplit</TT>
must also determine where these new entries go (original page or right
sibling) after the split and returns this in the <TT>&lt;x>GoesRight</TT>
parameters.</DD>

<DT>
union_page(gist_p&amp; page, vec_t&amp; bp, bool&amp; changed)</DT>

<DD>
This function is equivalent to the <TT>union_page</TT> function in <TT>gist_unordered_t</TT>,
except that instead of a predicate cursor the page is passed in directly
and the BP is passed in as a <TT>vec_t</TT> parameter. The function sets
<TT>changed</TT> to <TT>true</TT> if the BP changed.</DD>

<DT>
union_key(vec_t&amp; bp, int level, const vec_t&amp; pred, bool&amp; changed)</DT>

<DT>
check(const vec_t&amp; bp, const vec_t&amp; pred, int level)</DT>

<DT>
printPred(const vec_t&amp; pred, int level)</DT>

<DT>
printData(const vec_t&amp; data)</DT>

<DD>
These functions are identical to their counterparts in <TT>gist_unordered_t</TT>,
except that the predicate pointer and byte size are encapsulated in a <TT>vec_t
</TT>parameter.</DD>
</DL>

<H2>
<A NAME="Ancillary Classes for the Node-Layout Extension"></A>Ancillary
Classes for the Node-Layout Extension Interface</H2>
There are two ancillary classes for the libgist extension designer: <TT><A HREF="#gist_p">gist_p</A></TT>
(header file <TT><A HREF="#Appendix B: gist_p.h">gist_p.h</A></TT>), the
index node class, and <TT><A HREF="#vec_t">vec_t</A></TT> (header file
- you might have guessed it - <TT><A HREF="#Appendix C: vec.h">vec_t.h</A></TT>),
which simplify dealing with pointer/length pairs.

<P>Libgist makes the page structure and management functions of its
index nodes available through the class <TT><A
HREF="#gist_p">gist_p</A></TT>.  This class implements a simple
slotted page organization (defined by <TT><A
HREF="#page_s">page_s</A></TT>) - with a page header at the beginning
and a slot directory at the end of the page - and specifies the format
of the page entries. The entries have headers (structure <TT><A
HREF="#keyrec_t">keyrec_t</A></TT>), which contain the size in bytes
of the predicate and the data pointer, as well as a child pointer
(only useful for internal nodes). The entries are required to store
the predicate and data pointer portions contiguously (but either one
can have length 0). Also, the length info stored in the header must
reflect the actual length of the predicate stored on the page, even if
it is compressed and the expanded lengths deviate from the stored
length. Class <TT>gist_p</TT> stores a header record and a BP on every
page in the first and second available slot (only root pages do not
contain a BP). Nevertheless, the data entries added to the page by the
<TT>gist_p</TT> user still start at slot index 0, because the public
member functions of <TT>gist_p</TT> automatically compensate for the
header and the BP. Subclasses of <TT>gist_ext_t</TT> must use
<TT>gist_p</TT> to implement the desired node layout and the entries
of a node must have the <TT>keyrec_t</TT> header. Furthermore, every
item on the page that has its own data or child pointer must have its
own slot and header associated with it, so that both pointers are
accessible via <TT>gist_p::rec(slotindex).elem()</TT> and
<TT>gist_p::rec(slotindex).child()</TT>.  (Unfortunately, this rules
out storing duplicates as (pred, data ptr1, data ptr2, ...) lists;
this might be fixed in a future version of libgist.)  The constant
<tt>gist_p::max_tup_sz</tt> specifies the maximum size that a

<a name="cursor_abstract"><h2>Cursor Abstractions</h2></a>

<p>
The <i>cursor</i> (<tt>gist_cursor_t</tt>) corresponds to the basic
notions of a scan and its associated state.  The application
instantiates the cursor object directly, but the object cannot be used
until it has been initialized.  Among other things, this cursor
initialization process creates an instance of the appropriate
<i>cursor extension object</i> (<tt>gist_cursorext_t</tt>) and
attaches it to its parent cursor.  The relationship between a cursor
and a cursor extension object is analogous to that of a GiST
(<tt>gist</tt>) and its GiST extension object (<tt>gist_ext_t</tt>).
That is, the cursor extension abstracts the customization interface
from the cursor interface that is visible to the application.

<p>
The value of this abstraction is demonstrated by the following
(exemplary) sequence of events.  An application constructs a query
object specified by user input (<i>e.g.</i>, using the
<tt>amdb_ext_t::parseQuery</tt> interface).  The application
instantiates a generic query cursor and initializes it using the
user-specified query object.  The initialization process automatically
determines the type of traversal (<i>e.g.</i>, depth-first search or
nearest-neighbor search) from the query object and sets up the cursor
data structure appropriately.  The application can now retrieve
records using the cursor.  At no time during this process does the
application itself have to know what data type or search semantics the
user has specified.

<p>
We now restate the abstraction in terms of the code.  The
<tt>gist_cursorext_t</tt> objects are never made directly visible to
the application.  As mentioned above, cursor extension objects are
instantiated when the cursor is initialized.  Specifically, this
happens when <tt>gist::fetch_init</tt> calls
<tt>gist_ext_t::queryCursor</tt> with a specified
<tt>gist_query_t</tt> query object.  Subsequent operations are only
invoked by various <tt>gist_ext_t</tt> methods (<i>e.g.</i>,
<tt>fetch</tt>).

<a name="cursor_basic"><h2>Basic Cursor Implementations</h2></a>

<p>
The cursor instance contains pointers to its associated metadata (the
extension object <tt>gist_ext_t</tt>, the query predicate object
<tt>gist_query_t</tt>, <i>etc.</i>).  It also provides a place for
cursor implementations to store two kinds of information between
invocations: the <i>iterator</i> (an object which stores the records
yet to be visited) and any additional <i>state</i> (scratchpad
information).  While the iterator is just a particular kind of
scratchpad state, it is useful to decouple the two because
<i>traversal order</i> and the overall <i>computation</i> are often
independent.  For example, the notion of ``first <i>n</i> results''
search can be applied to either depth-first search or nearest-neighbor
search (albeit with different semantics).  The <tt>gist_cursor_t</tt>
interface is specified in <tt>gist_cursor.h</tt>.

<p>
Libgist provides two kinds of iterators, both of which are also
implemented in <tt>gist_cursor.h</tt>.  The <i>priority queue</i>
iterator (<tt>gist_prioq_t</tt>) provides the basic abstraction: node
entries are inserted into the iterator and are then extracted in an
arbitrary user-defined order.  The user-defined orders are stored in
an instance of type <tt>gist_penalty_t</tt>; node entries are
extracted smallest-value-first.  The <i>lookup stack</i> iterator
(<tt>gist_lstk</tt>) is just a special case of the priority queue
abstraction, but since stacks are used to implement a very common form
of traversal (depth-first search), they are provided as a separate,
low-overhead implementation option.

<p>
If you are writing a basic search tree that only uses depth-first
search, your implementation of <tt>queryCursor</tt> need only return
the generic stack-based cursor extension (the B-tree extension does
exactly this in <tt>bt_ext_t::queryCursor</tt>).  If your access
method supports other functionality, you will need to provide
customized cursor extension objects as described below.

<a name="cursor_custom"><h2>Customized Cursor Extension Objects</h2></a>

The following material is only necessary for extenders who intend to
write their own cursor extensions.

<p>
<tt>gist_cursorext_t</tt> is an abstract virtual class.  This class
(and its immediate subclasses) are defined in
<tt>gist_cursorext.h</tt>.  It defines two interfaces:
<ul>

<li><b>Run-time registration</b>.  Each cursor extension must be
assigned a unique identifier entry in
<tt>gist_cursorext_t::gist_cursorext_id</tt>.  When the libgist
application instantiates a given cursor extension object, the base
<tt>gist_cursorext_t</tt> class initializer registers the extension's
presence in a global data structure.  This enables other objects to
refer to a cursor extension <i>by name</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, by searching
the global data structure using its well-known identifier).  (This is
analogous to the registration interface by which each structural
extension must be registered using <tt>gist_ext_t::gist_ext_ids</tt>.)

<li><b>Iterator interface</b>.  The actual functional interface
provided by each cursor extension is fairly simple and essentially
constitutes a generic wrapper around the interface of its underlying
iterator.

<ul>

<li><tt>iter_reset</tt>.
Clears any previous state from the iterator.

<li><tt>iter_init</tt>.
Prepares a new or newly-reset iterator for its first use.

<li><tt>iter_update</tt>.
Inserts a new node entry into the iterator.

<li><tt>iter_fetch</tt>.
Retrieves a previously-stored node entry from the iterator.

</ul>

The specific interfaces are documented in the header file
<tt>gist_cursorext.h</tt>. 

</ul>

<p>
A given <tt>gist_cursorext_t</tt> may be applied to any
<tt>gist_ext_t</tt> that contains the same pair of internal/leaf key
types and supports the same query object.  Just as a
<tt>gist_ext_t</tt> corresponds to the 4-tuple
{internal-type,leaf-type,query-type,AM} and contains the necessary
``system catalog'' information for that combination, a
<tt>gist_cursorext_t</tt> corresponds to the 4-tuple
{internal-type,leaf-type,query-type,iterator}.

<p>
We expect that most custom cursor extensions will be produced by
subclassing <tt>gist_queue_cursorext_t</tt>.  This is because
<tt>gist_cursorext_t</tt> does not provide any iterator behavior and
<tt>gist_stack_cursorext_t</tt> already provides all of the
functionality needed any stack-based cursor extension.  The
<tt>gist_queue_cursorext_t</tt> class provides two user-extensible
callbacks, one to store an instance of a specific data type in the
priority queue and another to compute the priority with which that
instance will be retrieved.  For example, nearest-neighbor search can
be easily implemented in this framework by providing a distance
function as the priority callback.
